    description: |
      Result of the **Data Content** diff failure only, aggregated by columns.

      - ðŸŸ¢ GOOD: No data, Or Has data and the `match_percentage` can be well-explained e.g. new columns, behavior changes
      - ðŸ”´ BAD: Has data and `match_percentage` cannot be explained

      It will also link to the addtional result tables,
      formatted as `data_diff_check_detail_{source_table}_{YYYYMMDD}`,
      which is the result of EXCEPT operator contains all the different rows,
      the structure will be the same as the compared objects

      NOTE: the additional result table(s) will be replaced if there is an existing one

    columns:

      - name: diff_feeded_rate
        description: |
          Percentage of matching values of the given column compared to all the differences (*).

          (*) = different_in_source + different_in_target

          For example, the Diff result of TableA is having 10 diff rows:
          - 5 rows different_in_source
          - 5 rows different_in_target

          then, for each column:
          - Column1: count(matched) = 10  --> column feeded rate = 1    --> there is no diff in this column
          - Column2: count(matched) = 5   --> column feeded rate = 0.5  --> we have data diff in Column2 in 5 (out of 10) diff rows above
          - Column3: count(matched) = 0   --> column feeded rate = 0    --> we have a critical data diff in Column3
      - name: match_percentage
        description: |
          Percentage of matching values of the given column compared to total table row count.

          For example, the Diff result of TableA is having 10 diff rows:
          - 5 rows different_in_source
          - 5 rows different_in_target
          - Target table has 100 rows in total

          then, for each column:
          - Column1: count(matched) = 99   --> match % = 0.99 = 99%
          - Column2: count(matched) = 10   --> match % = 0.1  = 10%
