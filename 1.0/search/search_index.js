If the change is needed as a patch for a minor version of dbt that has already been released (or is already a release candidate), a maintainer will backport the changes in your PR to the relevant \"latest\" release branch (<code>1.0.&lt;latest&gt;</code>, <code>1.1.&lt;latest&gt;</code>, ...). If an issue fix applies to a release branch, that fix should be first committed to the development branch and then to the release branch (rarely release-branch fixes may not apply to <code>main</code>).</li> <li>Releases: Before releasing a new minor version, we prepare a series of beta release candidates to allow users to test the new version in live environments. This is an important quality assurance step, as it exposes the new code to a wide variety of complicated deployments and can surface bugs before official release.
